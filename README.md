# Circadian Rhythms in Sun-Protected and Sun-Exposed Skin

This repo contains the R code associated with the manuscript *Comparative circadian transcriptome analysis reveals dampened and phase-advanced rhythms in sun-exposed human skin.* The data and results files are currently omitted due to privacy concerns, but will be added prior to publication of the paper.

The goal of this project was to detect and model circadian rhythms in gene expression, using time course bulk RNA-seq data from 20 subject, with skin biopsies taken from both the forearm (the *EXPOSED* site) and the buttocks (the *PROTECTED* site), at times 12 noon, 6PM, 12 midnight, and 6AM (``t = (12, 18, 0, 6)``).
